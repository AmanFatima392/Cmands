                  Add custom classes in config file

If we have to add some value which are not defined in tailwindcss like in font size there is 
no 10xl size and we want a size for our font bigger than 9xl then we will add values in the config file 
run this command to see default classes with their values

           npx tailwindcss init --full
as tailwindcss.config already exist and we add our custom classes in the extend for the ease we can create another 
config file just see the default classes we write our classes in the extend 
       
                 npx tailwindcss init confgAman --full // just to see and for ease
